# PlatePix Turbo 3000
A rudimentary Python script that attempts to count viral plaques &amp; bacterial formations for biological studies.

This program was used in conjunction with a 3D printed contraption that allowed for images with uniform lighting and angles to be taken with the user's phone.

Developed at Solano Community College in California for a Civic Engagement project, with the goal of highlighting the importance of computational tools and computer science skills in across STEM disciplines.

## Overview of computer technology within a biology aspect
### Increased Control:
* Computers are far more accurate than us and allow for more accurate results with the right parameters.
### Speed:
* From speed of capturing result to analyzing them, computers can do some physical and most mathematical/thinking tasks far faster.
### Automated:
* Tasks given to humans have to been done within a select amount of time or hours while computers can be left doing things over night and without the same needed rest.

## Project Objective
* The objective of our project is to recognize an ongoing problem within our community and create a solution for it. We believe that our solution, of an automated plaque counting program, can be easily accessed by a variety of people and close the gap between innovation and practicality, leading officials to recognize our project’s value and consider a widespread adoption of its use in our community, along with the increased implementation of technology in the field of biology.

## Project Solution
After extensive research and surveys within our community, it is clear that a project like ours will aid researchers in the process of counting plaques on petri dishes. 
Thus, we have created a 3D-Printed stand with adjustable LED lighting and a phone holder, as a well as a program that can count plaques on a plate, packed with adjustable settings to the user’s desire.
