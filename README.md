# PlatePix Turbo 3000
A rudimentary Python script that attempts to count viral plaques &amp; bacterial formations for biological studies.

This program was used in conjunction with a 3D printed contraption that allowed for images with uniform lighting and angles to be taken with the user's phone.

Developed at Solano Community College in California for a Civic Engagement project, with the goal of highlighting the importance of computational tools and computer science skills in across STEM disciplines.
